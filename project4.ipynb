    "#### Adiabatic cloud\n",
    "Some higher density clumps of gas started to form in the adiabatic cloud but around $t\\sim$ 1.5 Myr the gas began to expand and the higher density perturbations were almost entirely erased  by the end of the simulation (**Fig.1**). \n",
    "In fact, for an adiabatic gas, the areas where the density increases also see a significant rise in temperature (over 10$^3$ K in this case) and pressure, which eventually overcomes the gravitational force and reverses the collapse. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior doesn't necessarily reflect the evolution of a real molecular cloud, where dust and molecular cooling become more effective as the gas temperature rises above 10 K, with the effect of lowering it again and allowing the collapse to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isothermal cloud\n",
    "In the case of the isothermal cloud, the higer density perturbations created by the turbulent velocity field became unstable in a few different areas and rapidly collapsed around $t\\sim2.4$ (**Fig.1**). This led to the formation of structures of number density  $n>10^5 cm^{-3}$ towards the center of the cloud, which are also visible in **Mov.1**. By the end of the simulation most of these structures had merged into two rotating disks with number density  $n\\sim10^{12} cm^{-3}$, located close to the center of the cloud and accreting gas from the surrounding area (**Fig.2**).\n",
    "The gas density is high enough for star formation to take place in this area but the mass resolution of the simulation is too low to observe it and moreover the code doesn't include sink particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of the simulation two clumps of higher density gas are ejected in opposite directions from the center of the cloud towards the lower density exterior (visible in **Mov.1** ). The interface between the higher and lower density gas is expected to be unstable, however this is not observed in the simulation because SPH codes don't capture well the physics at the interface between fluids of different density because the resolution for the lower density fluid becomes too low.
